First project for ITMD362- Human Computer Interaction.

Project description:

"This project requires you to create a compelling page design and sign-up process to get new users to join some type of project: an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source community. Project emphasis will be on effortless, engaging entry of personal information; and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or incomplete information. The goal of this project is to hit on particular patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re offering—not at all an easy task."
